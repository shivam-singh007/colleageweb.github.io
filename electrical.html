                          <p>Electrical Engineering has all the time in demand as its spectrum grows with advancement of all area of Technology.  Globalization, Signing GATT, Overseas collaboration transfer of  technology, etc call  for high quality standard and technology up gradation at all level in the industry, electrical engineer has key role to play.

Electricity is the lifeline of all other field of technology. Any  physical system be it of Mechanical, Electronics, Computer, Chemical, Plastic, Textile Engineering, electricity keeps the heart beating of all industries, Generation system, Transmitting system, Utilization system, Design, Manufacturing, Erection, Commissioning, R & D, are the routine electrical systems requires electrical engineers.

Keeping such requirement in mind competent and experienced faculty of our Electrical Engineering department prepares the students by giving ample assignments, conducting test, allowing extra industrial Practice/ Testing at concern local or nearby industries, national level Research & Testing institutions like  CSIR, INDO-GERMAN TOOL ROOM, INGERSOLE RAND, ISRO, PRL, TATA, SAIL, etc. Preparing them to participate in national as well as international fair imparting industrial training for one full term for industrial expose and arranging industrial visits
